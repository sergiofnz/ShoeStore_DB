# PHP-SQL-shoe-store
This project was developed for a server-side web development course I took through BU's graduate program. I built an online shoe store web app using PHP/MySQL. The project follows PHP MVC design structure and includes a shopping cart feature that, when an order is complete, persists the order info to the database and updates tables accordingly.
